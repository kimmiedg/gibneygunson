              | As a member of a superannuation fund, you may qualify for disability benefits. If you can’t perform your usual work or suitable alternative work, you may be entitled to receive a total and permanent disability
              | (TPD) payment. Some superannuation funds also offer total and temporary disability (TTD) benefits, which are regular payments, often monthly, by way of income support.

                    | Disability claims are complex. Claims are often initially denied by the insurer on the basis of fitness for work. In many claims, the insurer will dispute the extent of disability. In claims involving acute pain, such as back pain
                    | claims, the superannuation insurer will often deny that there is an injury. Gibney & Gunson has years of experience and considerable expertise in assisting their clients to manage these often challenging claims.
                  p
                    | We are familiar with the major superannuation funds, and we deal also with the smaller funds. We have specific knowledge about the different superannuation disability schemes, the different superannuation insurers, the nature of the
                    | disability schemes (which differ between superannuation insurers), and the issues the superannuation insurers find relevant. We pride ourselves on successfully navigating our clients through the often complex claims process and are proud
                    | of our clients’ success rate.
